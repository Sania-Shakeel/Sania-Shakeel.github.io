            The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and
            weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder<b> Ann Baker</b>> developed Ragdolls
            in the
            1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name 'Ragdoll'
            is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when
            picked up. The breed is particularly popular in both the<i> United Kingdom and the United States</i>.
            Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats", due to their tendency to follow people
            around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.[2]<br>

        <p>The breed was developed in Riverside, California, by breeder Ann Baker. A regular, non-pedigreed, white
            domestic longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats.[4] Josephine was of a
            Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which
            had the Siamese point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament,
            affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up.[5]

            Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all-black Burmese-like male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point
            with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a
            dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls
            are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.
